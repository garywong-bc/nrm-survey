# NRM LimeSurvey

OpenShift templates for LimeSurvey, used within Natural Resources Ministries and ready for deployment on [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/). [LimeSurvey](https://www.limesurvey.org/) is an open-source PHP application with a relational database for persistent data.

## Prerequisites

For build:

- Administrator access to an [Openshift](https://console.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/k8s/cluster/projects) Project namespace

Once built, this image may be deployed to a separate namespace with the appropriate `system:image-puller` role.

For deployment:

- Administrator access to an [Openshift](https://console.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/k8s/cluster/projects) Project namespace
- the [oc](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html) CLI tool, installed on your local workstation
- access to this public [GitHub Repo](./)

Once deployed, any visitors to the site will require a modern browser (e.g. Edge, FF, Chrome, Opera etc.) with activated JavaScript (see official LimeSurvey [docs](https://manual.limesurvey.org/Installation_-_LimeSurvey_CE#Make_sure_you_can_use_LimeSurvey_on_your_website))

## Files

- [OpenShift LimeSurvey app template](ci/openshift/limesurvey-bcgov.dc.yaml) for LimeSurvey PHP application, with PostgreSQL Database
- [OpenShift Database service template](ci/openshift/postgresql.dc.yaml) for a PostgreSQL Database


## Build

export TOOLS=245e18-tools
export PROJECT=245e18-dev
export SURVEY=test514


### Custom Image

To create an image stream using this forked code (replace `<tools-namespace>` with your `-tools` project namespace).

> oc -n &lt;tools-namespace&gt; create istag limesurvey-bcgov:latest

> oc -n &lt;tools-namespace&gt; process -f ci/openshift/limesurvey-bcgov.bc.yaml | oc -n &lt;tools-namespace&gt; apply -f -

> oc -n &lt;tools-namespace&gt; start-build limesurvey-bcgov

Tag with the correct release version, matching the `major.minor` release tag at the source [repo](https://github.com/LimeSurvey/LimeSurvey). For example:

> oc -n &lt;tools-namespace&gt; tag limesurvey-bcgov:latest limesurvey-bcgov:5.1.4


## Deploy

### Database Deployment

Deploy the DB using the correct SURVEY_NAME parameter (e.g. an acronym that is prefixed to `limesurvey`):

> oc -n &lt;project&gt; new-app --file=./ci/openshift/postgresql.dc.yaml -p SURVEY_NAME=&lt;survey&gt;

All DB deployments are based on the out-of-the-box [OpenShift Database Image](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/using_images/db_images/postgresql.html).

### Application Deployment

Deploy the Application using the survey-specific parameter (e.g. `<survey>limesurvey`):

> oc -n &lt;project&gt; new-app --file=./ci/openshift/limesurvey.dc.yaml -p SURVEY_NAME=&lt;survey&gt;limesurvey -p ADMIN_EMAIL=&lt;Email.Address&gt;@gov.bc.ca

oc -n 599f0a-dev new-app --file=./ci/openshift/limesurvey.dc.yaml -p SURVEY_NAME=testlimesurvey -p ADMIN_EMAIL=Gary.T.Wong@gov.bc.ca

NOTE: The ADMIN_EMAIL is required, and you override the ADMIN_USER and ADMIN_NAME. The ADMIN_PASSWORD is automatically generated by the template; be sure to note the generated password (shown in the output of this command on the screen).

#### Perform LimeSurvey installation

Run the [command line install](<https://manual.limesurvey.org/Installation_using_a_command_line_interface_(CLI)>) via `oc rsh`, with the correct SURVEY_NAME and credentials:

> oc -n &lt;project&gt; rsh $(oc -n &lt;project&gt; get pods | grep &lt;survey&gt;limesurvey-app- | grep -v deploy | grep Running | head -n 1 | awk '{print $1}')

> cd /var/www/html/application/commands/
> php console.php install ${ADMIN_USER} ${ADMIN_PASSWORD} ${ADMIN_NAME} ${ADMIN_EMAIL}

NOTE that the `${ADMIN_*}` text is exactly as written, since the app has access to these environment variables (set during the `new-app` step).

**TODO** back up as part of 'backup containers' for user uploaded files?

</details>

### Log into the LimeSurvey app

Once the application has finished the initial install you may log in as the admin user (created in either of the two methods above). Use the correct Survey acronym in the URL:
`https://<survey>limesurvey.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/index.php/admin`

## Example Deployment

As a concrete example of a survey with the acronym `acme`, deployed in the project namespace `599f0a-dev`, here are the steps:

```

#### Perform LimeSurvey installation

Automatic now .. but let the DB spin up first.


### Log into the LimeSurvey app

The Administrative interface is at:
https://acmelimesurvey.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/index.php/admin/

and brings to you a screen like:
![Admin Logon](./docs/images/AdminLogin.png)

Once logged as an Admin, you'll be brought to the Welcome page:

## Using Environmental variables to deploy

As this is a template deployment, it may be easier to set environment variable for the deployment, so using the example &lt;project&gt; is `599f0a-dev` and &lt;survey&gt; is `PAWS Limesurvey`:

<details><summary>Deployment Steps</summary>

### Set the environment variables

On a workstation logged into the OpenShift Console:

```bash
export PROJECT=599f0a-dev
export SURVEY=paws
```

### Database Deployment

```bash
oc -n ${PROJECT} new-app --file=./ci/openshift/postgresql.dc.yaml -p SURVEY_NAME=${SURVEY}
```

```bash
oc -n ${PROJECT} new-app --file=./ci/openshift/postgresql.dc.yaml -p SURVEY_NAME=${SURVEY}
--> Deploying template "245e18-dev/nrms-postgresql-dc" for "./openshift/postgresql.dc.yaml" to project 245e18-dev

     * With parameters:
        * Survey Name=newlimesurvey
        * Memory Limit=512Mi
        * PostgreSQL Connection Password=gjbrrc5xhJFj78n5 # generated
        * Database Volume Capacity=1Gi

--> Creating resources ...
    secret "newlimesurvey-postgresql" created
    persistentvolumeclaim "newlimesurvey-postgresql" created
    deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "newlimesurvey-postgresql" created
    service "newlimesurvey-postgresql" created
--> Success
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose service/newlimesurvey-postgresql' 
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
```

### App Deployment

Wait about 30 seconds, and/or confirm via the GUI that the DB is up:


```bash
oc -n ${PROJECT} new-app --file=./ci/openshift/limesurvey-bcgov.dc.yaml -p SURVEY_NAME=${SURVEY} -p ADMIN_EMAIL=Gary.T.Wong@gov.bc.ca -p ADMIN_NAME="IITD LimeSurvey Administrator"
```


#### Perform LimeSurvey installation

Automatic now..

### Log into the LimeSurvey app

The Administrative interface is at:
https://${SURVEY}.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/index.php/admin/

and bring to you a screen like:
![Admin Logon](./docs/images/AdminLogin.png)

Once logged as an Admin, you'll be brought to the Welcome page:

## FAQ

- to login the database, open the DB pod terminal (via OpenShift Console or `oc rsh`) and enter:

  `psql -U ${POSTGREQL_USER} ${POSTGRESQL_DATABASE}`

- to clean-up database deployments:

  `oc -n <project> delete secret/<survey>limesurvey-postgresql dc/<survey>limesurvey-postgresql svc/<survey>limesurvey-postgresql`

  NOTE: The Database Volume will be left as-is in case there is critical business data, so to delete:

  `oc -n <project> delete pvc/<survey>limesurvey-postgresql`

  or if using environment variables:

```bash
    oc -n ${PROJECT} delete secret/${SURVEY}limesurvey-postgresql dc/${SURVEY}limesurvey-postgresql svc/${SURVEY}limesurvey-postgresql
    oc -n ${PROJECT} delete pvc/${SURVEY}limesurvey-postgresql
```

- to clean-up application deployments:

`oc -n <project> delete secret/<survey>limesurvey-admin-cred dc/<survey>limesurvey-app svc/<survey>limesurvey route/<survey>limesurvey horizontalpodautoscaler/<survey>limesurvey`

  NOTE: The Uploads Volume is left intact in case there is user-uploaded assets on it; if not (i.e. it's a brand-new survey):  
`oc -n <project> delete pvc/<survey>limesurvey-app-config pvc/<survey>limesurvey-app-upload pvc/<survey>limesurvey-app-plugins`

  or if using environment variables:

```bash
    oc -n ${PROJECT} delete secret/${SURVEY}limesurvey-app dc/${SURVEY}limesurvey-app svc/${SURVEY}limesurvey-app route/${SURVEY}limesurvey-app hpa/${SURVEY}limesurvey-app pvc/${SURVEY}limesurvey-app-config pvc/${SURVEY}limesurvey-app-upload pvc/${SURVEY}limesurvey-app-plugins
```

- to reset _all_ deployed objects (this will destroy all data and persistent volumes). Only do this on a botched initial install or if you have the DB backed up and ready to restore into the new wiped database.

  `oc -n <project> delete all,secret,pvc -l app=<survey>limesurvey`

  or if using environment variables:

```bash
    oc -n ${PROJECT} delete all,secret,pvc,hpa -l app=${SURVEY}limesurvey
```

- to dynamically get the pod name of the running pods, this is helpful:

  > oc -n &lt;project&gt; get pods | grep &lt;survey&gt;limesurvey-app- | grep -v deploy | grep Running | awk '{print \$1}'

- to customize the deployment with higher/lower resources, using environment variables, follow these examples:

  > oc -n ${PROJECT} new-app --file=./ci/openshift/postgresql.dc.yaml -p SURVEY_NAME=${SURVEY} -p MEMORY_LIMIT=768Mi -p DB_VOLUME_CAPACITY=1280Mi  
  > oc -n ${PROJECT} new-app --file=./ci/openshift/limesurvey.dc.yaml -p SURVEY_NAME=${SURVEY} -p ADMIN_EMAIL=John.Doe@gov.bc.ca -p ADMIN_NAME="IITD LimeSurvey Administrator" -p REPLICA_MIN=1

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/your/project/tags).

## [Unreleased]

- test out application upgrade (e.g. LimeSurvey updates their codebase)
- check for image triggers which force a redeploy (image tags.. latest -> v1)
- update `composer.json` to allow `ubi/php74` or `rhel/php74` images. Using the legacy OCP3 `openshift/php:71` is required due to following `require-dev` dependencies (not met in newer Openshift V4 images):

      ```bash
      Package facebook/webdriver is abandoned, you should avoid using it. Use php-webdriver/webdriver instead.
      Package phpunit/php-token-stream is abandoned, you should avoid using it. No replacement was suggested.
      Package phpunit/phpunit-mock-objects is abandoned, you should avoid using it. No replacement was suggested.
      ```

  These should be fixed either by upstream repo, or we can fork and update the dependencies to:

      ```php
        "require-dev": {
          "fphp-webdriver/webdriver": "*",
          ...
          "phpunit/phpunit": "~7.0"
      }
      ```

  There also `psr-4` warnings to fix (either by the upstream repo, or we can fork and fix); basically folder or file naming conventions to match plugin name:

  ```bash
    Generating optimized autoload files
    Class LimeSurvey\PluginManager\QuestionBase located in ./application/libraries/PluginManager/Question/QuestionBase.php does not comply with psr-4 autoloading standard. Skipping.
    Class LimeSurvey\PluginManager\QuestionPluginAbstract located in ./application/libraries/PluginManager/Question/QuestionPluginAbstract.php does not comply with psr-4 autoloading standard. Skipping.
    Class LimeSurvey\PluginManager\QuestionPluginBase located in ./application/libraries/PluginManager/Question/QuestionPluginBase.php does not comply with psr-4 autoloading standard. Skipping.
    Class LimeSurvey\PluginManager\iQuestion located in ./application/libraries/PluginManager/Question/iQuestion.php does not comply with psr-4 autoloading standard. Skipping.
    Class LimeSurvey\PluginManager\DbStorage located in ./application/libraries/PluginManager/Storage/DbStorage.php does not comply with psr-4 autoloading standard. Skipping.
    Class LimeSurvey\PluginManager\DummyStorage located in ./application/libraries/PluginManager/Storage/DummyStorage.php does not comply with psr-4 autoloading standard. Skipping.
    Class LimeSurvey\PluginManager\iPluginStorage located in ./application/libraries/PluginManager/Storage/iPluginStorage.php does not comply with psr-4 autoloading standard. Skipping.
  ```

Alternatively, switch to [Centos PHP7.1](https://hub.docker.com/layers/centos/php-71-centos7/7.1/images/sha256-1ff68d2e3445091561a258c94c33d73655c44f90fa408a91eeb74f496268f402?context=explore) image
